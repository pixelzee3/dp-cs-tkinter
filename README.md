# My beautiful (yes, âœ¨ Beautiful âœ¨ [ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©]) CS project

I had to create a children's book for kids using Tkinter. Why? Not sure -- I mean I would've made an .epub or at the very most made a web app.

Anyways, I'm too lazy to read over my own code to find bugs and crap~ so why don't YOU do it for me ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ.

## Found a bug? Open an issue! ðŸ”¨

I probably won't do anything about it, or even read it -- actually, maybe I will.

But because I probably won't do anything about it, you should just fix the bug for me (ðŸ˜ƒ) and open a pull request!!!

## Fixed the bug for me? (thanks sweetheart) Open a PR!!!

I'll read the code -- oh and the code BETTER work -- and merge it.

You get cool contribution points from GitHub. Also, you'll be highly regarded by me. Sounds like a good offer, right?

## Before you ask!!!

You might open the custom_pages.py file and say, "what in the steaming pile of shit is this?"

First of all: piss off. Second of all: why do you think I'm opening this repo, silly?

I'm too lazy to super-strictly follow proper OOP principles, so there was a lot of repetitive code. If you wanna clean it up for me, well, thanks. Otherwise, don't complain ðŸ˜ƒ.
